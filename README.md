* ✔️ **Platforms:** Raspberry Pi | Arduino | ROS2

**Design & UX**
* ✔️ Figma | Penpot | UX Research | Accessibility | UML Modeling

---

### 🎯 Current Focus

Alongside full-stack delivery, I'm actively working at the intersection of:
* **Systems Programming** — Rust and C++ for performance-critical applications
* **Embedded & Hardware Integration** — Connecting high-level interfaces with low-level systems
* **HMI Design** — Intuitive interfaces for industrial and robotics environments
* **Gen-AI Integration** — Applying AI across domains to elevate user experience

---

### 💡 What Sets Me Apart

I combine **aesthetic sensibility** with **technical depth** — from pixel-perfect interfaces to low-level system architecture. This cross-layer perspective lets me bridge UX design with performance engineering, whether shipping web applications or building hardware-integrated systems.
